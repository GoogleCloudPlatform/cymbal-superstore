# `/terraform`

This directory contains the Terraform code used to deploy the Cymbal Superstore app to your Google Cloud project. This environment is the base for the Duet AI demo; it's not itself the Duet demo, and therefore should be set up before you explore Duet or run the Duet demo, described [here](/README.md).
